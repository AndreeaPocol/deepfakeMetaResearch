# Seeing Is No Longer Believing: A Survey on the State of Deepfakes and Other Nonveridical Media

Note: This paper has been accepted to CGI 2023.

There are several components to this repo:
1. a few examples of deepfakes we generated (e.g., of Chris Hemsworth in a tiara)

Stable Diffusion 1            |  Stable Diffusion 2.1            |  Stable Diffusion 2.1                     | Stable Diffusion 2.1

2. a background study on the history and evolution of deepfakes (including visualizations for bibliometric data, usage metrics, etc.). [CS Rankings](https://csrankings.org/#/index) was used to determine the most prolific institutions for deepfake research. The Semantic Scholar UI was used to determine the number of deepfake papers published over the years. ![image](ss-ui.png)
1. the results of a [user study](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfiGjsBgBoocsFTsWCe4aypm6zpykkKzbn0QgX5CXUNdfpUBQ/viewform?fbzx=-1358400270121316312) wherein 260 participants were presented with 20 images (a combination of real and fake), and asked which ones they believed where real, which ones they believed were fake, and why.
